# Poptab
Pop out dem tabz yo.

### Wtf is this??
It's a chrome extension! You can visit the [Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cjcglaclkfjolpcfhgbdkfecgnmjdgfo) to install it. 

### Oh. Well, what does it do?
It adds a single option to your context menu when you right click on a page, called 'Popout!'
When you click it, it creates a new popup navigated to the same url as the page you right clicked on.
That's it!
